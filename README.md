# Task 3: Regularization and Optimization <br/> CC6204 Deep Learning, Universidad de Chile  <br/>
### Name: Humberto Rodrigues 

This project is the third part of the Quickstart to Neural Networks using Pytorch. The goal is the understanding of the most basic concepts and the creation of a model with regularization and initialization strategies. However, the code built is general enough to support more complex networks than the ones being explored in this work.
